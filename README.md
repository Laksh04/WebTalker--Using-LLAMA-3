The *WebTalker* chatbot is an advanced conversational agent designed to interact with website content in real-time, leveraging *LLama 3.3-70B Versatile* via the *Groq AI platform*. It offers a streamlined experience for users to extract information and insights from websites through natural language queries.
Key Features of the WebTalker Chatbot

1. *Integration with LLama 3.3-70B Versatile:*
   - The chatbot employs *LLama 3.3-70B*, a state-of-the-art language model, known for its contextual understanding and versatile performance across various tasks.

2. *Website-Specific Interaction:*
   - Users can provide a website URL, and the chatbot processes the content from the specified site, allowing users to ask questions about the content directly.

3. *Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):*
   - Combines *retrieval-based* and *generative AI* techniques:
     - *Retrieval*: Extracts relevant information from the website content.
     - *Generation*: Constructs human-like responses based on the extracted context and query.

4. *Real-Time Context Awareness:*
   - The chatbot maintains a *conversation history* to understand user queries in context and provides accurate, coherent answers over extended interactions.


 How It Works

1. *Website Content Processing:*
   - A URL provided by the user is processed using the *WebBaseLoader* to load the document content.
   - Content is split into chunks and converted into embeddings for indexing in the vector store.

2. *History-Aware Query Generation:*
   - User queries are passed through a *history-aware retriever chain*, which generates search queries tailored to the conversation's context.

3. *Conversational Chain Integration:*
   - The *retriever chain* fetches relevant chunks, and a *stuff documents chain* combines them with the user query to generate responses.

4. *Interactive Interface:*
   - Users type queries via the Streamlit chat input, and the chatbot responds interactively, maintaining the chat history in the session state.
